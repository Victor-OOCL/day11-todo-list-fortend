## O - **Objective**:
Today, I learned:
1. How to use `react-router` for routing and component switching.
2. How to make HTTP requests with `axios`.
3. How to use Ant Design components like `Button`, `Modal`, and `Input`.

## R - **Reflective**:
- React Router makes navigation in SPAs smooth without page reloads.
- Axios simplifies making HTTP requests and handling errors.
- Ant Design speeds up UI development with ready-to-use components.

## I - **Interpretive**:
- React Router is key for building dynamic SPAs with smooth navigation.
- Axios is a better tool for async requests compared to `fetch`.
- Ant Design helps create consistent, responsive UIs quickly.

## D - **Decisional**:
- I'll dive deeper into React Router's advanced features.
- I'll explore Axios interceptors and error handling.
- I'll use more Ant Design components to streamline UI development.
